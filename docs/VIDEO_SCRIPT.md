# 20-min demo plan (script skeleton)

Use developer stories as your narrative.

1. Show app running (public URL) + /api/health.
2. Story: Developer — lint stops bad code early.
3. Story: Tester — unit tests prevent regressions.
4. Story: DevOps — Docker builds are reproducible.
5. Story: DevOps — IaC validate/what-if protects production.
6. Story: SRE — smoke test + health check.
7. Effectiveness — time-to-feedback, pipeline duration, fail-fast ordering.
8. Reflection — challenges, improvements, and org/industry relevance.
